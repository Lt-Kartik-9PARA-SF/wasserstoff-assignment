 Approaach : started by buildng Navigation bar first and used React router for the routing part, then tried to build a worldmap with hexagons as it was a requirement and tried to do it using d3 library but time was limited so went ahead with the design part as hexagon map and other charts were very complex and time consuming.
 made total 3 pages and switching between pages is possible using top Navigation bar.
